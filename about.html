Cecil describes the Faceless Old Woman as "probably harmless," adding, "But maybe you shouldn't sleep in your home anymore, just in case."
She describes herself as motivated by "curiosity and concern." Most of her interactions with Night Vale citizens seem well-meaning, if creepy. 
She advises you to change your sheets more often,
to relax and stop worrying, and, if your name is Mike Nominen, 
to discipline your children more.She cleans, reorganizes, and even installs a faster browser for you. 
Even Hiram McDaniels, who grew up outside of Night Vale, calls her "vaguely familiar and unsettlingly comfortable."
After accidentally provoking the Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency to almost kill you, 
the Faceless Old Woman issues a public apology. When dangerous condos arrive in Night Vale,
 she warns Cecil to beware them. However, after Cecil leaves to deal with the condo situation,
 she refrains from telling his radio audience what's happening to him, because, in her 
  own words, she is "slightly malicious."
She often takes sharp likes and dislikes to things. 
She is easily upset by disorder, 
in particular the lack of organization in your fridge.
 She likes orderly things, such as old food stains with a distinct topography.
 She dislikes Hiram McDaniels' cave and the deep rumbling sound in the desert.
 She likes some of the bugs in your home, but not others.She feels strongly that Cecil's dining room table looks better now she's made it half a foot shorter.
 If your name is Felicia Jackson, she wants you to change clothes slowly.
Despite the tensions of the mayoral race,
 the Faceless Old Woman is on civil terms with her opponent, Hiram McDaniels. 
 During the debate, they both described each other as beautiful because they both do beautiful things.
 After Hiram was sentenced to death, she was involved in his plan to escape the prison .
She once said, "Nothing ever really happens to me. I am completely safe from harm, and this is a great burden."
She claims to understand every language, although not the one Chad intones in his living room whilst summoning something unknown.

During her opening statement for the mayoral debate, 
the Faceless Old Woman described herself as "living secretly in the home of every single resident" of Night Vale. 
Later on, she implied that she even lives secretly in Hiram McDaniels' cave.
Cecil once introduced the Faceless Old Woman as "someone I've known my whole life, and you have too." In a tape recording he made at age fifteen, 
Cecil mentioned interacting with the Faceless Old Woman who secretly lived in his family's home.
When she introduced herself to Kevin, she had to correct herself:
 "Well, most homes." She does not live in some homes(presumably in Desert Bluffs) and couldn't remember ever seeing him before.

Once, when Cecil called her "Faceless Old Woman," she told him, to his astonishment, 
that she had a name. He apparently found it kind of awkward to ask.
Later, she gave her name as simply the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home.
She has no birth certificate.

 <div class="grid-colspan2-c">
 <br>
She does "lots of things," including Bing searching for "pictures of dead wolves" and "the melting point of birds" and notating your copy of Infinite Jest. 
She came to public attention when she issued a statement revealing that she was confused by the way you organize your fridge, had changed your sheets, and wanted your wifi password. 
At first, the Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency seemed upset that she had alerted you and the media to her presence, and their agents surrounded your home. 
However, perhaps in response to the Faceless Old Woman's second statement, they soon retreated and did not use deadly force, regardless of how dead you might feel inside. 
The Faceless Old Woman apologized for the trouble. 
Also, she set your fridge on fire. It was upsetting her.
